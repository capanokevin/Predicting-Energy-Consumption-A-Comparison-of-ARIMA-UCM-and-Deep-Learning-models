# Predicting-Energy-Consumption-A-Comparison-of-ARIMA-UCM-and-Deep-Learning-models
This repository contains the data used in the paper titled "Energy Consumption Prediction: A Comparison of ARIMA, UCM, and a Transformer Deep Learning Model". The paper compares the performance of three models - ARIMA, UCM and a transformer deep learning model - on energy consumption prediction. This new deep learning architecture was able to outperform the classical statistical models with the lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE). 
The dataset provided in this repository can be used for replicating the results of the paper.
